- TailWindCSS : CSS framework.

# Expected Outcomes
The following outcomes are expected from this project:

- A server component (Back-End) realized with Quarkus, Hibernate and PostgreSQL in a micro-service architecture according to the REST architectural style to store and handle relevant data in database.
- Handle server sent events thanks to Quarkus, SmallRye Reactive Messaging and Apache Kafka.
- An Angular web application (Front-End) to let users experience all the aforementioned fuctionalities.
- An identity provider to handle Identification, Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.
